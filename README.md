# Game of Life

A simple implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) written in Rust and visualised using [Cursive](https://github.com/gyscos/cursive). The main purpose of this code was to facilitate my Rust learning with an enjoyable mini project.

## How to Use

```bash
cargo run --release
```
